This is a course I am taking to learn the fundamentals of building things.
Topics include woodworking, metal working, molding and casting, electronics
design and fabrication, and more.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>My motivation for taking classes for fabrication is to gain at least a few skills
when it comes to product development and manufacturing. I&rsquo;ve been 3D printing for
several years now and I feel I&rsquo;ve reached the point where I need to build things
that cannot be made on a printer alone. Hobbyist 3D printers are great for the
prototyping, but for anything serious, you need to bring in the big guns.</p>
<p>That became really apparent while I was working on the <a href="https://kalinkochnev.com/journey/nasabigidea/">NASA BIG Idea Challenge</a>.
We could not iterate fast or cheaply by sending in orders to be manufactured
by a machinist. If we could do it ourselves, we could have had a turnaround
of a few days rather than 1-2 weeks. It was really frustrating how much of a
bottleneck this was. So taking this course is how I hope to address that issue
in the future.</p>
<p>I am super excited to take this course and can&rsquo;t wait to share what I make!</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>After every unit of the course, I will have completed a project in a particular
method of fabrication.</p>
<h2 id="woodworking">Woodworking</h2>
<p>The tools I have been trained on (the basics) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood lathe</li>
<li>Tormek knife sharpender</li>
<li>Drill press</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools I am hoping to get trained on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table saw</li>
<li>Planar</li>
<li>Jointer</li>
<li>Shapokeo Pro CNC</li>
<li>Sliding compound miter saw</li>
</ul>
<p>The projects I am interested in doing for this unit are to try to create a chess
piece on the lathe and use the Shapokeo to cut a custom puzzle. I have really
enjoyed working on the lathe so far. It is really satisfying to use. I think
out of the woodworking tools the Shapokeo has the most applicability to engineering
work I will do.</p>
