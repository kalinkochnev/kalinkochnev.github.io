      <p>The great news is that making a self-standing bike is a solveable problem.</p>
<p>I was initially concerned that this might not be possible, but thankfully a lot of much smarter people have already done a lot of the math.
My hope is to use this as a learning experience and not necessarily re-invent the wheel (pun intended). The problem is way outside of my comfort zone, but it is in the realm of feasibility.
There is an established path in the literature so all I have to do is chip away and learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on this with one of my good friends, Vihaan Shah. I would include his website, except he still doesn&rsquo;t have one!</p>
<p>I did some literature review today and I mainly focused on the most recent papers. From working on the <a href="http://localhost:1313/journey/resonant/">Resonant</a> project again, I realized that it&rsquo;s easy to use outdated methods if you don&rsquo;t explicitly look for new ones.</p>
<p>The articles that left the best first impression in regard to good starting off points are here:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9988425">Sensorless Unmanned Bicycle Robot (2022)</a>:
I like this paper because it&rsquo;s recent and seems beginner friendly. This will probably be most useful for the case when we are piloting a bike and it&rsquo;s not standing still.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/11/3/371">Frame Angular Velocity Control Design of SGCMG for Unmanned Two-Wheeled Motorcycle (2023)</a>: This paper has a nice diagrams and outlines the physics well.</li>
<li><a href="https://sensors.myu-group.co.jp/article.php?ss=4168">Design of Self-balancing Model-size Electrical Motorbike Robot Using Control Moment Gyroscope (2022)</a>: For understanding the physics of gyroscopes and creating a scaled down prototype, this is also excellent for static balancing.</li>
