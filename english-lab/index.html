            <p><p>My mission, and dream, is to create educational content to inspire everyone to have an engineering mindset, or even study it! I attempt to develop solutions for complex engineering problems that are important to me, and show that anyone can be an engineer. Failure is a part of the process!</p>
<p>I have worked on passion projects for quite a while now, almost since elementary school depending on how you count the years. But my most recent accomplishments include:</p>
<p><strong>2022 NASA BIG Idea Challenge Finalist</strong>
I lead a team of 20 undergraduates with several others to compete in the BIG Idea Challenge. NASA <a href="">awarded my team</a> with $150,000 to pursue lunar robotics research for an entire year (2 semesters and a summer).</p>
<p>It was an eye-opening and an extremely humbling experience. My team and I missed the mark by a long shot, and in a highly public manner. Now our duct-taped, falling-apart prototype is forever immortalized in <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/lunar-robot-snakes-explore-the-moon-nasa">National Geographic</a>. Despite this, I learned a lot about how to build a product, and also what can go wrong. My main goal from this experience is to learn from my mistakes and help others make sure they don&rsquo;t make the same ones.</p>
<p><strong>2021 Highest Honors at the New York State Science Congress</strong>
This was a state wide science fair that I participated senior year of high school with <a href="https://www.rohanmenon.com/">Rohan Menon</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-yanoff-56b882168/">Jacob Yanoff</a>. Our hope was to develop a wearable, and discreet, device that could serve as an alternative to hearing aids for the deaf. We developed a prototype which won the highest honors at the state science fair.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about more about either project or check out my other projects.</p>
<p>Today, I am in the beginning of a new phase in my life, one where I figure out how to give back to the communities that have shaped me. Even though I am not the world&rsquo;s foremost engineer, I want to foster a community of <a href="">&ldquo;learning in public&rdquo;</a>. This is where one leaves a trail of notes and documentation that captures their learning journey while also exposing themselves to feedback from others. The purposes is twofold, to learn from others and so others can learn from you. Developing my portfolio is my first step on this journey. In the future, I will be creating video content to post alongside my journeys.</p>
<p>Post-NASA BIG Idea Challenge, I am working with the University of Connecticut administration to build infrastructure for students to gain the necessary skills and have access to tools in order to compete in future challenges. Additionally, the remaining members of the group hope to establish a student lab to serve as mentors and provide learning experiences for passionate engineering undergraduates. In the same way that NASA took a chance with us, I hope to provide a similar opportunity to others.</p>
<p>I am working on a second version of the Resonant project (the NYS science fair submission). There is a lot of potential applications with this technology in regards to accessibility and robotic sensing. I still have a lot left to explore with the fascinating signal processing and math behind it as well. It is my first project I am hoping to document in its entirety on my site and YouTube!</p>

                    This blog post is about how a lack of existential meaning can actually be a blessing rather than a curse. 
                    
                    This artifact was created as a part of BADM 2234 - The Entrepreneurial Journey course during my freshman year. We were asked to write blog posts about areas that were interesting to us. I chose to write about self improvement. This artifact, a blog post, represents my writing ability. I drew upon my personal experiences leading up to college to share my opinion on that I had thought about frequently. The art for this post was drawn by me. I chose to draw ice cream because that's what my mind associates with care-free time.

                <p> 
                    This blog post is about reflecting upon the harmful grind culture that is inspired in the name of productivity and taking a step back to avoid burnout.
                        
                    This artifact was also created as a part of BADM 2234. The art for this post was drawn by me in a playful style since that is the branding of my blog. I wrote this piece when I was feeling particularly burdened by the college experience. I searched for a way to address and resolve to some degree my stresses at the time through writing. This was a common occurence across any self improvement post I wrote. I write when trying to solve problems.

                    This blog post where I reflect on the hedonic treadmill, where the progress and success that we makes today eventually becomes the status quo. We end up always wanting more and more, which is a recipe for unhappiness. 

                    This artifact was also created as a part of BADM 2234. I decided to use this picture that I took on a hike because the trail represented an "endless path" that happiness and improvement both follow. This post has a different angle to the question of meaning that I first wrote about in "lol nothing matters". In "lol nothing matters", I view meaning as something that is free to choose. That results in a problem. What is worth pursuing? I attempt to shine some insight upon this question.

        <h2> Curator's Note </h2>
        <p>
            Together the three blog posts give a slice of the headspace I was in during freshman year. I was at a point where I felt that I had relatively little meaning in my life and was searching for answers through philosophical reflection. My written work was the culmination of several years of reading and experimentation in the self improvement space. The focus/theme of my curation are the "counter-culture" realizations I have made that often contradicted common belief in productivity/self-improvement. 
    
            I synthesized my own opinion and experience based on all I had seen up to that point. I think the three month time period in which I wrote these pieces were an important transition period of my life. Today, I don't entirely agree with all that I had said at the time, but I think it's an indication of growth. As time moves one, what I believe today isn't necessarily what I will believe tomorrow. What I've learned from curating these artifacts is in the same way that curation is the selection of items that satisfy a common theme, opinions can, and should, be seen as curation of thought. Absorbing someone elses entire worldview leads to disonance with reality. Everyone experiences reality differently, and it's important to pick and choose across a broad selection of views, to create balance.
