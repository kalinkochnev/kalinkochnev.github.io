      <description>My mission, and dream, is to create educational content to inspire everyone to have an engineering mindset, or even study it! I attempt to develop solutions for complex engineering problems that are important to me, and show that anyone can be an engineer. Failure is a part of the process!
I have worked on passion projects for quite a while now, almost since elementary school depending on how you count the years.</description>

      <description>Curation project lol nothing matters September 11th, 2021
This blog post is about how a lack of existential meaning can actually be a blessing rather than a curse. This artifact was created as a part of BADM 2234 - The Entrepreneurial Journey course during my freshman year. We were asked to write blog posts about areas that were interesting to us. I chose to write about self improvement. This artifact, a blog post, represents my writing ability.</description>
