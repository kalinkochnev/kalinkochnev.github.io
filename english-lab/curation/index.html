                    This blog post is about how a lack of existential meaning can actually be a blessing rather than a curse. 
                    
                    This artifact was created as a part of BADM 2234 - The Entrepreneurial Journey course during my freshman year. We were asked to write blog posts about areas that were interesting to us. I chose to write about self improvement. This artifact, a blog post, represents my writing ability. I drew upon my personal experiences leading up to college to share my opinion on that I had thought about frequently. The art for this post was drawn by me. I chose to draw ice cream because that's what my mind associates with care-free time.

                    This blog post is about reflecting upon the harmful grind culture that is inspired in the name of productivity and taking a step back to avoid burnout.
                        
                    This artifact was also created as a part of BADM 2234. The art for this post was drawn by me in a playful style since that is the branding of my blog. I wrote this piece when I was feeling particularly burdened by the college experience. I searched for a way to address and resolve to some degree my stresses at the time through writing. This was a common occurence across any self improvement post I wrote. I write when trying to solve problems.

                    This blog post where I reflect on the hedonic treadmill, where the progress and success that we makes today eventually becomes the status quo. We end up always wanting more and more, which is a recipe for unhappiness. 

                    This artifact was also created as a part of BADM 2234. I decided to use this picture that I took on a hike because the trail represented an "endless path" that happiness and improvement both follow. This post has a different angle to the question of meaning that I first wrote about in "lol nothing matters". In "lol nothing matters", I view meaning as something that is free to choose. That results in a problem. What is worth pursuing? I attempt to shine some insight upon this question.

        <h2> Curator's Note </h2>
        <p>
            Together the three blog posts give a slice of the headspace I was in during freshman year. I was at a point where I felt that I had relatively little meaning in my life and was searching for answers through philosophical reflection. My written work was the culmination of several years of reading and experimentation in the self improvement space. The focus/theme of my curation are the "counter-culture" realizations I have made that often contradicted common belief in productivity/self-improvement. 
    
            I synthesized my own opinion and experience based on all I had seen up to that point. I think the three month time period in which I wrote these pieces were an important transition period of my life. Today, I don't entirely agree with all that I had said at the time, but I think it's an indication of growth. As time moves one, what I believe today isn't necessarily what I will believe tomorrow. What I've learned from curating these artifacts is in the same way that curation is the selection of items that satisfy a common theme, opinions can, and should, be seen as curation of thought. Absorbing someone elses entire worldview leads to disonance with reality. Everyone experiences reality differently, and it's important to pick and choose across a broad selection of views, to create balance.
