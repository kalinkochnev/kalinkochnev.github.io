interested in understanding peoples&rsquo; relationships with technology. How can we balance the good and the bad aspects of technology, and specifically, the internet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I have searched for answers through my own explorations and experimentation. I have gone from opposite extremes, from excessive usage of the internet back to the stone age and its simplicity. From those experiences I have realized that extremes are not the answer, as is the case with most things. I sought to understand how others have developed their opinions and relationship with technology. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">From my experience, most people indict their usage of the internet. They wish that they could use less of it so they can focus on other aspects of their life that are important to them. I also fall into the same category. I wish I could use less of it. However, I wanted to flip the script. I wanted to highlight the benefits technology can bring into our lives and remind us that it&rsquo;s not all bad. We shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad for how we use the internet and instead we should be aware of what role it plays in our life and how we can be more mindful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I hoped to gain some insight into an issue that many of us struggle with by examining how different generations view their predecessors and their successors. It includes addressing questions of how human nature changes or remains the same across time. And finally, what advice would generations give to one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">In this piece, while we see there are some differences in how each generation sees one anothers, the common thread is the belief that human values do not fundamentally change. There are qualities that remain valued through all time, such as love, family, and the desire for connection and knowledge. Technology can&rsquo;t change those things. It only gives us new ways to express those same values.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c12" id="h.g28mwoe1sisw"><span class="c18 c20"></span></h1><h1 class="c15" id="h.5h8e3kf4wfin"><span class="c16">Living in Today&rsquo;s Age</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c9">An interview with Kris Patel</span></p><h1 class="c15" id="h.71zsu03op5mg"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 534.61px; height: 569.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 534.61px; height: 569.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c2">Kris Patel on a vacation with his family to Dubai</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Kris Patel is a sophomore at Boston University studying Computer Science. He is close with his family back home: his parents, grandmother, and his younger brother. He is passionate about technology, math, philosophy, and enjoys spending his free time writing. He has strong and unique opinions, but also is open minded and always willing to consider different views. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">How do you think your childhood is different from that of people today? Or is there no difference?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I feel like my childhood wasn&#39;t that much different from the childhoods of people who are growing up right now. I think the biggest difference is that technology is a lot more available now even compared to when I was a kid. I didn&#39;t have a personal computer up until I was around 13 or so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I feel like people who grow up with technology, you hear the term iPad kids, often rely on the internet to raise their kids. Of course, this isn&#39;t like a universal concept, but I feel that is a lot more common today as compared to our childhoods. Maybe we spent a decent amount more time with our parents compared to the kids today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">What do you think this generation values today compared to your own?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I don&#39;t know if a value can change that much from my generation to the next. In general, I value family. I value spending time with people who I like and love a lot. Those are obviously similar things that carry through generations, but I think I also like the ease of life and communication brought by technology. I&#39;ve made a lot of friends online. Sometimes you hear that &ldquo;online friends aren&#39;t real friends&rdquo;. That obviously has merits, but I disagree. I think that it&#39;s more accurate to say that we are more open to making friendships on a technological basis. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">I made a bunch of friends when I was younger online and we&#39;ve remained in touch for over seven or eight years now. They are some of my best friends as well and I have only met one of them in person. But despite that, I still feel the way I do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">If you could change one thing about how people use technology today, what would you change?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I wish that people relied on things like social media less for social connections. With the phenomenon of so many kids being on the internet, I sort of wish that this sort of thing was&hellip; I wouldn&#39;t say limited because that&#39;s not a good mentality either. I wish it was in some way controlled up until a certain age when people are capable of processing how it can affect them.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c12" id="h.jhse2wsv9ld8"><span class="c18 c9"></span></h1><h1 class="c15" id="h.oss714e1gcaa"><span class="c16">A Dramatic Transition</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c9">An interview with Annie Holland</span></p><h1 class="c15" id="h.dw9tn2qjb5z5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 463.65px; height: 580.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 463.65px; height: 580.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c2">A portrait of Annie Holland</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Annie Holland is the proud and loving mother of three children, Kalin, Ellie, and Zora. She is an extremely creative individual and expresses her artistry in a variety of ways: cooking, cake decoration, drawing, graphic design, interior design, and wood burning. She is a staple in her local community and is always willing to lend a helping hand to others. She is also incredibly headstrong, with a hustle attitude. She had worked as a Marketing Director for most of her career, but after being diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, pivoted to consulting for the extra flexibility and to escape the stresses of the corporate world. Additionally, she owns and operates an extremely successful Airbnb in Walnut Beach, CT.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">How do you think your childhood is different from that of people today? Or is there no difference?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I have to say that one of the biggest differences that I see is the level of parental oversight. You have to realize that I grew up in a different country. I can speak only from my own experience from Bulgaria. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I grew up in an environment where, as a child from age five, I was extremely independent. I would be going shopping for groceries on my own. I would be taking a bus across town at the age of seven. I would go and explore the city where I lived with my friends, with no parental consent or supervision for twelve hours. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">My parents did not know where I was most of the time. That was the norm. It wasn&#39;t that my parents were not engaged. It was more of what the culture was. Everybody felt a lot safer to have their children do things on their own and spend time outside. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c20">What do you think this generation values today compared to your own?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">The values that we have were already existing, it&#39;s just that the polarization and the intensity of it [as a result of misinformation] actually became bigger. Families who have raised their children to appreciate the good that they can do in society, and how they can serve their community and their fellow men, are the same families that would have had those values for decades. Those values will not have changed because of technology. True, values can be influenced, but technology is not the cause. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Do you have an experience where you feel that the internet has empowered you as an individual?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Before the internet, there was no social accountability for people and institutions. Meaning, if you did something bad or somebody did something bad to you, the only people who would know are the people involved.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2"><br>For example, recording somebody for everybody to see was not possible before. But now, there is the expectation that pretty much anybody can record you at any time. Is it legal or not? That is a completely different question, but the reality is if you are doing something wrong and somebody does record you, there is the price that comes with that. Integrity is expected, and if you are not showing integrity you are definitely going to be held accountable. That is something really, really powerful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">What is your relationship with the internet like today? Do you feel that it is healthy/balanced or excessive?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I cannot imagine not being able to search for information and find it when I wanted it at my fingertips. And I&#39;m a very curious person. I like to learn new things, and I like to share things that I have learned with other people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Is it excessive? I&#39;m not entirely sure how to define that. What is excessive? Yes, I use the internet a lot of my time during the day, but I also use it for different purposes. I use it for work. I use it for education. I use it for even things like maintaining things in my life, like bills, taxes, and medical information. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">I&#39;m not counting how many hours I&#39;m using the internet or technology because the reality is, it&rsquo;s a lot. Now my life is extremely integrated with it. I cannot imagine being as productive and as informed as I am otherwise.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c15 c17" id="h.n8yld12d5wlf"><span class="c18 c20"></span></h1><h1 class="c15" id="h.xv7lunem4mn0"><span class="c16">A Bird&rsquo;s Eye View</span></h1><p class="c10"><span class="c9">An interview with Nedko Iliev</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 575.00px; height: 475.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 575.00px; height: 475.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">Nedko Iliev watching a basketball game on a visit to the United States </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nedko Kochnev is the grandfather of the author and has lived in Bulgaria his entire life. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease many years ago, but doesn&rsquo;t let that keep him down. He is incredibly kind and loves to share his thoughts and experiences. One of his favorite things to talk about is space and technology and he loves to play chess with others. He worked various jobs when he was younger, like elevator maintenance, telecommunications installation, and later for the Bulgarian postal service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">How do you think your earlier life is different from that of people today?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">When I was younger, there were not as many opportunities to have as much communication as there is right now. One of the biggest differences is that when I was younger, all the information that I needed was mostly gathered from books, magazines, and any type of specialty literature that could be used for any technical purposes. So any reference that was done was done to literary sources.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Many things today tend to come with very little effort. Children today are focused a lot on playing video games and not doing anything else. The way that information is exchanged today, everything is received more often and faster. That has changed things dramatically. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">What do you think this generation values today compared to your own?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The values of the current generation are more focused on consumerism. What is the next thing to buy and how can I spend my money? People focus on consumption and &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; of goods that come easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">What is your relationship with the internet like today?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m divided on how to answer this question. I realize that the internet now is needed, but we cannot rely only on it for accurate information. The information can often be misleading and is not scientifically proven. Somehow, information should be verified and approved. While the internet is useful, I do not rely on it with the same trust that I had in the very beginning when it first came out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">If you could change one thing about how people use technology today, what would you change?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">I want to see technologies being used for their usefulness, not for just entertainment. Technology should be used more for good, and right now that&rsquo;s not the case. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Any other thoughts?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9">I think the push to build the metaverse, when people are communicating with each other through a simulated reality, is a very double edged sword. I feel that people can easily be manipulated if that is the environment they experience because people are going to rely on what they see. If that reality can be manipulated within the virtual setting, it can make people truly believe falsehoods.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
